   <h2>Description:</h2>
   <p>A slice of pizza is a modern staple in the United States.  With italian origins, who knew a slice of bread and cheese could be so innovative?</p>
   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>1 cup Warm Water</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tsp. 1 package Instant Yeast</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. Granulated Cane Sugar</li>
    <li>2 tsp. Salt</li>
    <li>1/3 cup Milk</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. Olive Oil</li>
    <li>3 cups All Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Finely Ground Cornmeal</li>
    <h4>Recipe:</h4>
    <ol>
     <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the warm water, sugar, and instant yeast. Mix just to combine and set aside for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
<li>Add the olive oil, milk, salt, and 3 cups flour to the stand mixer bowl. Using the hook attachment, mix on LOW speed for 2-3 minutes, until a shaggy dough. Increase speed to Medium to knead with the dough 3-5 minutes, until smooth and pliable. When you press a finger into the dough, it should slowly bounce back.</li>
<li>Cover to rest 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 2-3 pieces. Place in a greased baking pan, drizzle the tops with a little olive oil, then cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm environment for 1.5 – 3 hours, depending on how cold your kitchen is. The dough should be doubled in size when ready to use.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 500F for 30 minutes. Place the pizza rack in the oven to heat, as well.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the cornmeal on a clean surface to help gently stretch out the pizza to have a thin bottom and 1/2" thick crust.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the pizza rack from the oven and place on a heat-safe surface. Add the stretched-out pizza dough onto the pizza rack.</li>
<li>Drizzle lightly with olive oil, then spoon a thin layer of the pizza sauce on top.</li>
<li>Add about 3/4 cups shredded mozzarella, 3-4 fresh mozzarella slices, and freshly grated pecorino or parmesan.</li>
<li>Bake for 8-12 minutes, until golden and crispy to desired preference.</li>
<li>Garnish with more freshly grated pecorino or parmesan, chopped basil, and cracked black pepper. Repeat with the remaining pizza doughs. Enjoy warm!</li>
